# Workers API

## This project is a verry simple project of using workers API. 
## It allows you to run scripts in the background, separate from the main thread
## in this page if you click the button "calculate sum", it calculates the sum of 1 to 2000000000 (which is a heavy operation and it takes time) and while it is running in the background, you can also change the background color with the left side button.
